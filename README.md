# Celebs flying irresponsibly: The flightpath to a climate nightmare.
When we talk about climate change, carbon emission is often the focal point of the conversation. It's no secret that flying is the least eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, the average person traveling on a crowded passenger flight partially lessens the impact. Private jet passengers are the real source of aviation problems. They are the worst offenders for emissions per passenger. Celebrities frequently choose these flights over more environmentally friendly options, taking incredibly short trips instead.

Private aviation has never experienced greater activity. For example, NetJets reported a 30% increase over pre-pandemic levels in 2021, while Vista Global Holdings recorded a 64% increase year over year for its VistaJet and XO brands. That boom was undoubtedly fueled primarily by people switching to private flying due to Covid-19, but it is likely to continue even after the pandemic phase has passed. For example, 92 percent of Private Jet Card Comparisons members said they would fly the same amount or more in 2022 as last year.

# Methodology
The data for the project was scrapped from Celebrity Jets on Twitter. Celebrity Jets is an Automated bot that tracks the Private Jets of celebrities. It is coded and run by Jack Sweeney, who came to the limelight for tracking Elon Musk's Private Jet. The data contains the Co2 emissions of 20 celebrities who flew private from March 2022 to September 2022 (SIX months of data). The data looks at the number of flights each celebrity took so far, the total Co2 emissions in metric tons, and the top offenders. Finally, we compared them to the average Co2 emissions per individual in the United States for 2021.
